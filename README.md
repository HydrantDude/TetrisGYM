## Getting Started

TetrisGYM is distributed in the form of an BPS patch and can be applied with [Rom PatcherJS](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/) or similar.

It can only be applied to the USA version of the ROM. However, after patching it will detect your console region, and gameplay will either match the corresponding NTSC or PAL versions of the game.

A link to the BPS can be found in the releases page. [TODO ADD LINK]

## Modes

### Play
